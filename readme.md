# JavaScript Message v4.0

The fourth iteration of JavaScript Message, a social platform intended for in-school use. Man, you do not want to see the other versions. I originally made it using Firebase... for... some reason? Because I was, like, in 8th grade and had no idea what actual coding was? Then a made a bunch of changes and revisions to release version 2. And version 3 happened somewhere in between then and now. And, well, there's really no reason for this to exist, so I'm maintaining it purely as an archive.

The server still exists on [Replit](https://replit.com/@RogerCronin1/JSM-v40-Backend). I can't promise if it'll work in the future.
